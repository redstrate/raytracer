# Raytracer

A multi-threaded raytracer using glm, tinyobjloader and C++17. The UI is written in imgui and image display is
rendered using OpenGL. I tried to write this to not be insanely fast or compact like other raytracers, but to be readable and understandable.

![example result](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/redstrate/raytracer/master/misc/output.png)

The example image shown above is rendered using simple direct light computation and naive indirect light sampling.
